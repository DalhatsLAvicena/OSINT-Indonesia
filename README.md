# OSINT-Indonesia

Collection of OSINT resources for Indonesia. Inspired by [OSINT for Countries](https://github.com/wddadk/OSINT-for-countries) by @wddadk. 

I often see country-specific OSINT resources in tutorials, but I rarely came across OSINT tools specifically made for Indonesia. As an Indonesian, I feel obligated to collect OSINT resources to help online researchers who are researching Indonesia.
